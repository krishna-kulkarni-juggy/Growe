CRITICAL ISSUES: 1) Role-based access control not enforced - 3PL partners can access admin pages via direct URLs. 2) Map View requires Google Maps API key.

CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED: 1) Backend Lease model doesn't support enhanced fields (lease_agreement, action_items, financial_summary) - frontend uses demo data only. 2) Industry news endpoints missing (/api/industry-news) - client portal news feed is frontend-only. 3) Action items API endpoints not implemented. WORKING WELL: Basic API health maintained, performance excellent (21ms), data consistency good, basic filtering/sorting works. Backend needs enhancement to match frontend capabilities."
